            <h3>Graphic Design for Gala Weddings</h3>
            <p>
              For this project, I had the opportunity to design promotional
              materials for Gala Weddings' exclusive home event packages. The
              design features a sophisticated and modern aesthetic, blending
              elegant visuals with clear, concise messaging. The color scheme
              utilizes soft neutrals and dark tones, evoking a sense of luxury
              and exclusivity, while the dynamic composition directs attention
              to key details like the event offerings and price.

            <h3>Graphic Design for Fitness Gym</h3>
            <p>
              I created a dynamic and balanced layout to showcase key services
              like personal training, group classes, and memberships.
              High-impact images of gym equipment and people engaged in workouts
              are used to evoke motivation, while the clear typography ensures
              easy readability. The inclusion of action-oriented phrases and
              call-to-action buttons encourages potential clients to join or
              inquire about the gym’s services.

            <h3>Graphic Design for Kempinski Cafe & Playstation Lounge</h3>
            <p>
              For this project, I designed promotional materials for Kempinski
              Cafe & Playstation Lounge, a sophisticated venue offering a blend
              of high-end dining and interactive gaming experiences. The design
              reflects the fusion of luxury and fun, with a color palette of
              deep, rich tones like gold, black, and dark maroon, evoking
              elegance and exclusivity, while incorporating modern, playful
              elements to highlight the gaming aspect.
